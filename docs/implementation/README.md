## Documentation Guidelines

When adding new implementation docs:

1. **Be Clear and Concise** - Focus on architecture and core processes
2. **Include Diagrams** - Use mermaid diagrams where helpful
3. **Code Examples** - Show key code patterns and interfaces
4. **Avoid Implementation Details** - Don't document every line of code
5. **Keep Updated** - Update when major changes occur

Each implementation doc should include:

```markdown
